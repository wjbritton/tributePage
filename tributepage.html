<h2>What is Cryptocurrency?</h2>
<p>A cryptocurrency (or crypto currency) is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange using cryptography to secure the transactions and to control the creation of additional units of the currency. Cryptocurrencies are a subset of alternative currencies, or specifically of digital currencies.
Bitcoin became the first decentralized cryptocurrency in 2009. Since then, numerous cryptocurrencies have been created. These are frequently called altcoins, as a blend of bitcoin alternative. Bitcoin and its derivatives use decentralized control as opposed to centralized electronic money/centralized banking systems. The decentralized control is related to the use of bitcoin's blockchain transaction database in the role of a distributed ledger.

<h2>History</h2>
<p>
  In 1998, Wei Dai published a description of "b-money", an anonymous, distributed electronic cash system. Shortly thereafter, Nick Szabo created "Bit Gold". Like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that would follow it, Bit Gold was an electronic currency system which required users to complete a proof of work function with solutions being cryptographically put together and published. A currency system based on a reusable proof of work was later created by Hal Finney who followed the work of Dai and Szabo.
The first decentralized cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was created in 2009 by pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto. It used SHA-256, a cryptographic hash function, as its proof-of-work scheme. In April 2011, Namecoin was created as an attempt at forming a decentralized DNS, which would make internet censorship very difficult. Soon after, in October 2011, Litecoin was released. It was the first successful cryptocurrency to use scrypt as its hash function instead of SHA-256. Another notable cryptocurrency, Peercoin was the first to use a proof-of-work/proof-of-stake hybrid. Many other cryptocurrencies have been created though few have been successful, as they have brought little in the way of technical innovation. On 6 August 2014, the UK announced its Treasury had been commissioned to do a study of cryptocurrencies, and what role, if any, they can play in the UK economy. The study was also to report on whether regulation should be considered.

<h2>Cryptocurrency Quotes</h2>
<p> Bitcoin is exciting because it shows how cheap it can be. Bitcoin is better than currency in that you don	&#39;t have to be physically in the same place and, of course, for large transactions, currency can get pretty inconvenient. <br><strong>- Bill Gates</strong></p>
<br>
<p>Well, I think it is working. There may be other currencies like it that may be even better. But in the meantime, there&#39;s a big industry around Bitcoin. People have made fortunes off Bitcoin, some have lost money. It is volatile, but people make money off of volatility too.<br> <strong>- Richard Brandson</strong></p>
<br>
<p>You can&#39;t stop things like Bitcoin. It will be everywhere and the world will have to readjust. World governments will have to readjust<br> <strong>- John McAfee</strong></p>
<br>
<p>Itâ€™s gold for nerds.<br> <strong>- Stephen Colbert</strong></p>
